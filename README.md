Bomberman

This was just a proof of concept and to learn Node.JS and how to make multiplayer games.

For singleplayer just press Create Game > Select your game (ex 1001) > press Start Game

Controler:

w - move up
s - move down

a - move left
d - move right

space - drop bomb

r - reset

m - I just created it to see map grid, to debug


Also "work" on your mobile browser with swipe to move and dubble press to drop bomb.

I used Socket.io for the multiplayer part.
